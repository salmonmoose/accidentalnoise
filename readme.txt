Description:
A modular library written in C++ for the generation of Perlin noise and other forms of noise in 2, 3, 4 and 6 dimensions.
  
Usage:

Add all .CPP files in directory src/ to project, set include path to include/, and include anl.h.

Documentation for the modules can be found at http://accidentalnoise.sourceforge.net/docs.html and usage examples can be found at http://accidentalnoise.sourceforge.net/examples.html

Bindings to the Accidental Noise Library for Lua, as well as code for parsing a tree declaration of modules, can be found in the lua/ folder. Bindings are generated by tolua++ ( http://www.codenix.com/~tolua/ ). See http://accidentalnoise.sourceforge.net/lua.html
